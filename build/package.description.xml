				&lt;p&gt;The Adobe Flex approach of binding in MXML has some serious flaws.
				Most important is that its not available in Flash Professional,
				but also the performance and the code-only-usability leaves space
				for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
				
				&lt;p&gt;Binding as opposed to Connecting describs a 
				&lt;strong&gt;property&lt;/strong&gt; based approach to update changes.
				In case one property changes the other one changes accordingly.
				&lt;/p&gt;
				
				&lt;p&gt;The nanosome binding mechanism tries to accomplish follow
				targets:&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Make sure its as fast as possible. (preferrably faster than
					flex binding).&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Allow binding of non-flex code to flex code.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Make it easy to use without mxml.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Allow master-client sychronization.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;/ul&gt;
				
				&lt;p&gt;Essentially all binding here binds <code>IField</code>
				instances like described in &lt;code&gt;nansome.notify.field.IField&lt;/code&gt;
				together. In case you want to bind regular objects there is the
				<code>watch</code> functionality that should be quite helpful. Please
				refer to its documentation for more information about the internals.
				&lt;/p&gt;
